# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Policy (2026-08-04):** Hand-maintained. Every user-facing fix/feature PR updates
`## [Unreleased]`. On tag release, move those bullets under a new version heading
and clear Unreleased. Do **not** leave changelog work to printing-press-library
automation for this independent repo (that rule applies only when publishing
*into* the library catalog).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `quotation-report query` reads admitted Daily Quotation Report rows across sessions on contract `pse-edge-quotation-rows-v1`. `quotation-report index` loads revisions already named by `index.json` and does not download PDFs. The `data.db` tables are internal. A dash stays null `reported_dash`, not zero. This does not change `history`, `export eod`, or `pse_eod_prices` ([#61](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/61)).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `filings day` downloads one Asia/Manila publication day's disclosure bodies and attachments into a local evidence bundle (`pse-edge-disclosure-day-v1`). Search discovery stays `announcements/search.ax` and never claims the official corpus is complete. Reruns keep original bytes, store changed files as revisions, and retry failures up to `--max-attempts` ([#57](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/57)).

- `quotation-report --date YYYYMMDD` reads the official PSE Daily Quotation Report for that session. The command discovers the End of Day Quotes PDF from the market-report listing, keeps the original bytes and SHA-256, and emits contract `pse-edge-quotation-report-v1` (symbol, OHLC, volume, value, net foreign, page/row locator, provenance). A dash is null `reported_dash`, not a zero or a suspension. A file that ends before `GRAND TOTAL`, a security row with a missing or broken number, or any of the nine column headings missing or reordered (including multiline headings) is not admitted. This does not change `history` or `pse-edge-export-eod-v1`. PDF text needs Poppler `pdftotext`. `acquired_at` is the only clock ([#56](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/56)).

### Fixed

- `filings day` clears stale download failures after successful recovery, records returns to older revisions without duplicating bytes, reports missing disclosure bodies as partial bundles, and confines file access to the output directory even when symlinks are present.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Installer no longer writes a self-referential `pp-pse-edge` link when the skills dir already exposes that skill (the fleet layout symlinks `~/.claude/skills` at the canonical skills tree). The duplicate link left git-tracked churn on every machine that syncs that tree. Real per-skill farms and any other layout still get wired.
- `quote` keeps the edge leg when EDGE serves a direction-only change cell (`down (%)`), and a null `change` is never paired with a numeric `change_pct` — a phisix-only fallback now serves `change_pct: null` instead of `0` ([#52](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/52)).
- `sync market` persists the composite index snapshot (with breadth) for the last completed session the page reports, instead of only inside the post-close clock window, so local breadth no longer freezes on intraday or next-morning runs; a composite page whose indices disagree on the session date is skipped rather than misdated; `export index` adds `change_status`/`breadth_status` and `breadth` states when a window has no breadth-bearing sessions ([#53](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/53)).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `filings latest-body SYMBOL` — one-shot newest search-row `file_id` plus `downloadHtml.do` document body. `filings SYMBOL` stays index-only (no `file_id` on rows); `filings get --edge-no` still returns viewer `document_file_id` / attachment ids ([#31](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/31)).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `history --json` (and `--agent`, nested under the usual `{meta, results}` envelope) now emit a coverage wrapper instead of a bare array: `{"bars": [...], "coverage": {"first","last","gaps"}, "session_last_completed", "stale", "sync_required"}`. The coverage/stale signal lets automation distinguish "no data" from "not synced" — `coverage.last < session_last_completed` means the local series is stale; `sync_required: true` means the store has never been synced for that symbol. `coverage.gaps` lists days the local best-effort calendar expects to trade within the series span that carry no bar (null when the series is empty or the window is outside the calendar's known holiday years, in which case `calendar_coverage` is surfaced); unscheduled closures and suspensions appear as gaps, trailing unsynced sessions do not. `--csv`/`--plain` and the default human output continue to render the bars as rows/table (issue #32).

### Fixed

- `filings` adds `corpus: "announcements_search_only"` to search JSON, preserves corpus warnings under `--agent`, and documents scan bounds and direct viewer recovery for empty searches ([#29](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/29)).
- `disclosures document` and `filings latest-body` extract PDF text layers with Poppler `pdftotext`. Missing extractor, invalid PDFs, and PDFs without text now exit non-zero; HTML extraction is unchanged ([#30](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/30)).
- `history` and `export eod` emit `volume_status` (`ok` or `unavailable`) so a missing share volume is never confused with a genuine zero. Null `volume` is now explicit on history JSON. Contract id stays `pse-edge-export-eod-v1` ([#27](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/27)).
- `disclosures document --file-id` now returns a structured body (`file_id`, `content_type`, `text`, `byte_length`) for HTML and PDF attachments instead of `{ "results": {} }` with exit 0. PDF is sniffed from `%PDF-` magic bytes; empty or unusable bodies exit non-zero ([#28](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/28)).
- Data race in the learn loop's query-synonym registry (`RegisterQuerySynonyms`) that could crash concurrent installs with `fatal error: concurrent map writes`. Registration and reads are now guarded by a package-level `sync.RWMutex`, with a pinned `-race` regression test. CI now runs `go test -race ./...`.

### Security

- Release job now installs syft so SBOM generation can run.
- Release assets are now signed keylessly with cosign (sigstore), bound to the GitHub Actions OIDC identity of the `release.yml` workflow at `refs/tags/v<semver>` (issue #26). The release is published as a draft and promoted only after the signature passes the same verification `install.sh` uses. `install.sh` verifies the checksums signature (cosign `--bundle`, requires cosign ≥ 2.4.2) when cosign is on PATH, with an explicit checksum-only fallback otherwise; `PSE_EDGE_REQUIRE_COSIGN=1` makes the fallback a hard failure. A failed signature verification is always fatal. Trust root and limits documented in README.
- `--deliver webhook:<url>` now refuses destinations that resolve to private / link-local / cloud-metadata / reserved IP ranges (SSRF guard, issue #25), including NAT64 well-known (`64:ff9b::/96`) and local-use (`64:ff9b:1::/48`) prefixes. The guard also re-validates every redirect hop. Opt out explicitly with `--deliver-webhook-allow-private`. DNS resolution failure blocks delivery (fail-closed); the check is resolve-then-check and does not defend against DNS rebinding. The flag is blocked from the MCP tool surface alongside `--deliver`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Move repo and Go module to [`ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli`](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli) (User-Agent strings unchanged).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-18

### Security

- Require Go 1.26.6 (stdlib vulns GO-2026-6090 / 6089 / 5972 / 5026 on 1.26.5). Pin CI and release `setup-go` to `1.26.6` so Dependabot PRs can pass `govulncheck` ([#22](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/22)).

### Changed

- Bump `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` 0.57.0 → 0.58.0 ([#20](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/20)).
- Bump `golang.org/x/net` 0.57.0 → 0.58.0 ([#21](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/21)).
- Bump `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.55.0 → 1.56.0 ([#19](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/19)).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `filings get --edge-no` — direct `openDiscViewer.do` lookup when search omits a known disclosure ([#10](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/10), [#15](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/15)).
- Local-store export for downstream pipelines: `export eod`, `export index`, `export companies-local` with versioned per-row `contract` ids (`pse-edge-export-*-v1`) ([#9](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/9), [#18](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/18)).
- Downstream integration guide: `docs/downstream-integration.md` ([#9](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/9)).
- Security review notes: `docs/security-review-20260805.md` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13), [#17](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/17)).
- `which` indexes `filings` and `export` for capability routing ([#16](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/16)).

### Changed

- `filings` JSON exposes search honesty fields: `complete` (search set only), `truncated`, `page_cap_hit`, `freshness_gap_days`, standing `warnings` that `announcements/search.ax` is not an authoritative complete corpus ([#10](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/10)).
- MCP HTTP default bind is loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:7777`); warn on non-loopback binds (no auth) ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).

### Security

- `scripts/install.sh` verifies prebuilt release tarballs against the release `checksums.txt` (SHA-256) before extract; refuse install on missing entry or mismatch ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- `filings` / `filings get` HTTP clients set an explicit 60s timeout ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- SQLite DSN builder rejects path URI metacharacters that could override `mode=ro`; MCP blocks `--db` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- Cross-host HTTP redirects drop `Config.Headers` keys, not only `Authorization` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Parse PSE Edge `stockData.do` down-day `Change(% Change)` cells that use U+00A0 interior percent whitespace; require `up`/`down` prefix so an unmatched direction word cannot silently invert sign ([#8](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/8),
  [#14](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/14)).

### Changed

- Bump `golang.org/x/net` 0.55.0 → 0.57.0 ([#12](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/12)).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Five-step densify parallel quote path; `resolveVersion` for non-dev installs (see release notes / git history).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Initial public release: agent-native PSE Edge CLI (quotes, filings, local
  history, MCP).
