# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Policy (2026-08-04):** Hand-maintained. Every user-facing fix/feature PR updates
`## [Unreleased]`. On tag release, move those bullets under a new version heading
and clear Unreleased. Do **not** leave changelog work to printing-press-library
automation for this independent repo (that rule applies only when publishing
*into* the library catalog).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `history --json` (and `--agent`, nested under the usual `{meta, results}` envelope) now emit a coverage wrapper instead of a bare array: `{"bars": [...], "coverage": {"first","last","gaps"}, "session_last_completed", "stale", "sync_required"}`. The coverage/stale signal lets automation distinguish "no data" from "not synced" — `coverage.last < session_last_completed` means the local series is stale; `sync_required: true` means the store has never been synced for that symbol. `coverage.gaps` lists days the local best-effort calendar expects to trade within the series span that carry no bar (null when the series is empty or the window is outside the calendar's known holiday years, in which case `calendar_coverage` is surfaced); unscheduled closures and suspensions appear as gaps, trailing unsynced sessions do not. `--csv`/`--plain` and the default human output continue to render the bars as rows/table (issue #32).

### Fixed

- Data race in the learn loop's query-synonym registry (`RegisterQuerySynonyms`) that could crash concurrent installs with `fatal error: concurrent map writes`. Registration and reads are now guarded by a package-level `sync.RWMutex`, with a pinned `-race` regression test. CI now runs `go test -race ./...`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Move repo and Go module to [`ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli`](https://github.com/ph-commons/pse-edge-pp-cli) (User-Agent strings unchanged).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-18

### Security

- Require Go 1.26.6 (stdlib vulns GO-2026-6090 / 6089 / 5972 / 5026 on 1.26.5). Pin CI and release `setup-go` to `1.26.6` so Dependabot PRs can pass `govulncheck` ([#22](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/22)).

### Changed

- Bump `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` 0.57.0 → 0.58.0 ([#20](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/20)).
- Bump `golang.org/x/net` 0.57.0 → 0.58.0 ([#21](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/21)).
- Bump `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.55.0 → 1.56.0 ([#19](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/19)).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `filings get --edge-no` — direct `openDiscViewer.do` lookup when search omits a known disclosure ([#10](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/10), [#15](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/15)).
- Local-store export for downstream pipelines: `export eod`, `export index`, `export companies-local` with versioned per-row `contract` ids (`pse-edge-export-*-v1`) ([#9](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/9), [#18](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/18)).
- Downstream integration guide: `docs/downstream-integration.md` ([#9](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/9)).
- Security review notes: `docs/security-review-20260805.md` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13), [#17](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/17)).
- `which` indexes `filings` and `export` for capability routing ([#16](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/16)).

### Changed

- `filings` JSON exposes search honesty fields: `complete` (search set only), `truncated`, `page_cap_hit`, `freshness_gap_days`, standing `warnings` that `announcements/search.ax` is not an authoritative complete corpus ([#10](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/10)).
- MCP HTTP default bind is loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:7777`); warn on non-loopback binds (no auth) ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).

### Security

- `scripts/install.sh` verifies prebuilt release tarballs against the release `checksums.txt` (SHA-256) before extract; refuse install on missing entry or mismatch ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- `filings` / `filings get` HTTP clients set an explicit 60s timeout ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- SQLite DSN builder rejects path URI metacharacters that could override `mode=ro`; MCP blocks `--db` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).
- Cross-host HTTP redirects drop `Config.Headers` keys, not only `Authorization` ([#13](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/13)).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Parse PSE Edge `stockData.do` down-day `Change(% Change)` cells that use U+00A0 interior percent whitespace; require `up`/`down` prefix so an unmatched direction word cannot silently invert sign ([#8](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/issues/8),
  [#14](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/14)).

### Changed

- Bump `golang.org/x/net` 0.55.0 → 0.57.0 ([#12](https://github.com/ngpestelos/pse-edge-pp-cli/pull/12)).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Five-step densify parallel quote path; `resolveVersion` for non-dev installs (see release notes / git history).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Initial public release: agent-native PSE Edge CLI (quotes, filings, local
  history, MCP).
